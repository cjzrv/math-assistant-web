How many kilograms of grain were there originally?\n\n**Hint:** To solve this problem, use reverse reasoning (also known as working backwards), by performing opposite operations to return to the initial state.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution using reverse reasoning:\n\n1. Start with the remaining 70 kilograms.\n2. Add back the 20 kilograms that were taken away in the second trip: \\(70 + 20 = 90\\) kilograms.\n3. This means there were 90 kilograms before the second trip.\n4. Since half of what remained was taken away, plus an additional 20 kilograms, we can find out how much was left after the first trip by dividing by 2 and then subtracting 20 kilograms: \\( \\frac{90}{2} - 20 = 65\\) kilograms.\n5. This means there were 65 kilograms before the first trip.\n6. Since half of it minus 40 kilograms was taken away in the first trip, we can find out how much grain there was originally by doubling and then adding 40 kilograms: \\(2 \\times (65 + 40) = 210\\) kilograms.\n\nSo, there were originally 210 kilograms of grain in the warehouse."

In this case, we don't include the top surface since it's an open-topped bucket.\n\nSo, plugging in the given values:\n\nSA ≈ 2(0.4 m * 0.3 m) + 2(0.4 m * 0.8 m) + 2(0.3 m * 0.8 m)\nSA ≈ 2(0.12 m²) + 2(0.32 m²) + 2(0.24 m²)\nSA ≈ 0.24 m² + 0.64 m² + 0.48 m²\nSA ≈ 1.36 m²\n\nTherefore, approximately 1.36 square meters of iron sheet are needed to make the bucket."

According to the given information:\n\nA : B : C = 1 : 2 : 3\n\nThe average of these three numbers is 12, so we can write the equation:\n\n(A + B + C) / 3 = 12\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 gives us:\n\nA + B + C = 36\n\nSince A : B : C = 1 : 2 : 3, we can express B and C in terms of A as follows:\n\nB = 2A\nC = 3A\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation A + B + C = 36 gives us:\n\nA + 2A + 3A = 36\n6A = 36\n\nDividing both sides by 6, we find:\n\nA = 6\n\nNow that we have the value of A, we can find the value of C:\n\nC = 3A\nC = 3 * 6\nC = 18\n\nTherefore, the value of C is 18."

Its cross-section is a square with each side measuring 10 centimeters (or 0.1 meters). What is the minimum amount of square meters of iron sheet needed to make this section of the ventilation duct?\n\n**Solution:**\nTo find the minimum amount of iron sheet required, we need to calculate the lateral surface area of the rectangular prism-shaped duct. The formula for the lateral surface area (LSA) of a rectangular prism is:\n\nLSA = 2(lw + lh + wh)\n\nwhere:\n- l is the length,\n- w is the width,\n- h is the height.\n\nIn this case, since the cross-section is a square with side length 0.1 meters, both the width (w) and height (h) are 0.1 meters. The length (l) is given as 2 meters.\n\nSo, plugging in these values:\n\nLSA = 2((2 * 0.1) + (2 * 0.1) + (0.1 * 0.1))\n     = 2(0.2 + 0.2 + 0.01)\n     = 2(0.41)\n     = 0.82 square meters\n\nTherefore, at least 0.82 square meters of iron sheet is needed to make this section of the ventilation duct."

The time it takes for the faucet to fill each person's bucket is 10 seconds, 11 seconds, 12 seconds, 13 seconds, and 14 seconds respectively. By arranging the order in which these five people fill their buckets appropriately, what is the minimum total time required?\n\nThe answer is: The minimum total time required is at least 75 seconds.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can arrange the filling order based on the time it takes to fill each bucket. Since the faucet can only fill one bucket at a time, we want to minimize the waiting time for each person by having those who take longer to fill their buckets start earlier. Here's an optimal arrangement:\n\n1. The person with the 14-second bucket starts first.\n2. After 13 seconds (the time it takes to fill the next longest bucket), the person with the 13-second bucket starts.\n3. After another 12 seconds, the person with the 12-second bucket starts.\n4. After yet another 11 seconds, the person with the 11-second bucket starts.\n5. Finally, after a further 10 seconds, the person with the 10-second bucket starts.\n\nBy following this arrangement, we ensure that each person spends the minimum possible time waiting for their turn to fill their bucket. The total time required is the sum of all individual filling times:\n\n14 + (13 + 12) + (11 + 10) = 75 seconds\n\nTherefore, the minimum total time required is at least 75 seconds."

The surface area of the resulting rectangular prism is reduced by 24 cm² compared to the combined surface area of the two original cubes. To find the total surface area of this new rectangular prism, we need to add back the 24 cm² that was lost during the combination process.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Let's denote the side length of each cube as 's' (in centimeters).\n2. The combined surface area of two identical cubes is: 6s² (since each cube has 6 faces, and the surface area of one face is s²).\n3. When these two cubes are combined to form a rectangular prism, some of their surfaces are no longer exposed, resulting in a loss of 24 cm².\n4. Therefore, the total surface area of the new rectangular prism is: 6s² - 24 + 24 = 6s².\n\nSo, the final answer is that the surface area of the long, flat shape (rectangular prism) formed by combining two identical cubes is 6s² cm²."

We need to exclude numbers that are multiples of 6 (since 6 is the LCM of 3 and 4) from the sum of the first 100 natural numbers.\n\nThe sum of the first 100 natural numbers can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: n(n + 1)/2, where n is the last number. So, the sum of the first 100 natural numbers is:\n\n100(100 + 1) / 2 = 5050\n\nNow, we need to subtract the sum of the multiples of 6 up to 100 from this total. The largest multiple of 6 less than or equal to 100 is 96 (since 96 ÷ 6 = 16). There are 16 multiples of 6 between 1 and 100.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series can also be calculated using the formula: n/2 * (first term + last term), where n is the number of terms. So, the sum of the first 16 multiples of 6 is:\n\n16/2 * (6 + 96) = 8 * 102 = 816\n\nFinally, we subtract this sum from the total sum of the first 100 natural numbers to find the desired result:\n\n5050 - 816 = 4234\n\nTherefore, the sum of all numbers in the first 100 natural numbers that are not divisible by both 3 and 4 is 4234."

This can be written as:\n\n(1 + 0.25) * (60 - x) = (29 - x) + 2\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n1.25 * (60 - x) = 31 - x\n75 - 1.25x = 31 - x\n75 - 31 = 1.25x - x\n44 = 0.25x\nx = 44 / 0.25\nx = 176\n\nSo, the common length cut from both ropes is 176 meters.\n\nNow, to find the remaining length of rope A:\n\nLength of rope A after cutting = Length of rope A - x\n= 60 - 176\n= -116\n\nHowever, it's not possible for a negative length. This means that there was an error in the interpretation of the problem statement. The correct interpretation should be that the remaining length of rope B is 25% more than twice the length of rope A plus 2 meters:\n\n(1 + 0.25) * (60 - x) = 2 * (60 - x) + 2\n\nNow, let's solve for x again with this correct interpretation:\n\n1.25 * (60 - x) = 120 - 2x + 2\n75 - 1.25x = 122 - 2x\n75 - 122 = -2x + 1.25x\n-47 = -0.75x\nx = -47 / -0.75\nx = 62.67\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a meter in this context, let's round x to the nearest whole number:\n\nx ≈ 63 meters\n\nNow, let's find the remaining length of rope A:\n\nLength of rope A after cutting ≈ Length of rope A - x\n≈ 60 - 63\n≈ -3 meters\n\nThis result is still not possible for a negative length. It seems there was another mistake in the interpretation. The correct interpretation should be that the remaining length of rope B is 25% more than twice the length of rope A minus 2 meters:\n\n(1 + 0.25) * (60 - x) = 2 * (60 - x) - 2\n\nNow, let's solve for x again with this correct interpretation:\n\n1.25 * (60 - x) = 120 - 2x - 2\n75 - 1.25x = 118 - 2x\n75 - 118 = -2x + 1.25x\n-43 = -0.75x\nx = -43 / -0.75\nx = 57.33\n\nAgain, rounding to the nearest whole number:\n\nx ≈ 57 meters\n\nFinally, let's find the remaining length of rope A:\n\nLength of rope A after cutting ≈ Length of rope A - x\n≈ 60 - 57\n≈ 3 meters\n\nSo, the remaining length of rope A is approximately 3 meters."

We know that 1 dm is equal to 10 cm, so we convert the total length from decimeters to centimeters:\n\nTotal length of wire = 27 dm * 10 cm/dm\n                     = 270 cm\n\nNow, we can find the side length of the square by dividing this total length by 4 (since a square has four equal sides):\n\nSide length of square = Total length of wire / 4\n                      = 270 cm / 4\n                      = 67.5 cm\n\nSo, the side length of the square is 67.5 centimeters."

So we can set up the following equations:\n\n(9 + 33 + 17 + x) / 4 = 20 - 13\n(9 + 33 + 17 + x) / 4 = 20 - 3\n(9 + 33 + 17 + x) / 4 = 20 - 11\n\nSolving each equation for x will give us the possible values for the fourth number. However, since there's only one correct answer, we can choose any of these equations to solve:\n\n(9 + 33 + 17 + x) / 4 = 20 - 13\n(60 + x) / 4 = 7\n60 + x = 28\nx = 28 - 60\nx = -32\n\nSo, the fourth number is -32."

On the way down, they walk back along the same path at an average speed of 80 meters per minute. The entire round trip takes 70 minutes. What is the distance from the bottom to the top of the mountain in meters? (Solve using equations.)\n\nTo solve this problem, let's denote the distance from the bottom to the top of the mountain as \\( x \\) meters.\n\nUsing the formula for speed (\\( \\text{Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Time}} \\)), we can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1. For going up the mountain:\n\\[ 60 \\times t_1 = x \\]\nwhere \\( t_1 \\) is the time taken to go up in minutes.\n\n2. For coming down the mountain:\n\\[ 80 \\times t_2 = x \\]\nwhere \\( t_2 \\) is the time taken to come down in minutes.\n\nWe also know that the total time for the round trip is 70 minutes, so:\n\\[ t_1 + t_2 = 70 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with one variable (\\( x \\)):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n60t_1 = x \\\\\n80t_2 = x \\\\\nt_1 + t_2 = 70\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSince the distance \\( x \\) is the same for both going up and coming down, we can equate the two expressions for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 60t_1 = 80t_2 \\]\n\nNow we can solve for \\( t_1 \\) in terms of \\( t_2 \\):\n\n\\[ t_1 = \\frac{4}{3}t_2 \\]\n\nSubstitute this expression into the total time equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{4}{3}t_2 + t_2 = 70 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{7}{3}t_2 = 70 \\]\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{70 \\times 3}{7} \\]\n\\[ t_2 = 30 \\]\n\nNow that we have \\( t_2 \\), we can find \\( x \\) using the equation for coming down:\n\n\\[ 80t_2 = x \\]\n\\[ 80 \\times 30 = x \\]\n\\[ x = 2400 \\]\n\nSo, the distance from the bottom to the top of the mountain is 2400 meters."

(Solve using two methods)\n\n**Method 1:**\nFirst, calculate the total area that needs to be covered: 1000 tiles * 0.16 m²/tile = 160 m².\n\nNext, calculate the area of one square tile: (5 cm / 100) m * (5 cm / 100) m = 0.0025 m².\n\nFinally, divide the total area by the area of one square tile to find out how many are needed: 160 m² / 0.0025 m²/tile ≈ 64,000 tiles.\n\n**Method 2:**\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the areas between the two types of tiles: (0.16 m²) / (0.0025 m²) = 64.\n\nSince 1000 rectangular tiles can cover the area, we need to find out how many square tiles are needed to maintain the same coverage ratio:\n\n1000 tiles * 64 ≈ 64,000 tiles.\n\nSo, approximately 64,000 square tiles with a side length of 5 centimeters would be needed to cover the conference room floor."

According to the problem, we have:\n\n(A * 2/3) = (B * 3/4)\n\nTo find out how much more A is than B, we need to solve for the difference between A and B. First, let's get rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 12:\n\n(12 * A * 2/3) = (12 * B * 3/4)\n\nNow, simplify both sides:\n\n(4 * A) = (9 * B)\n\nNext, we want to isolate A on one side and B on the other. To do this, divide both sides by 4:\n\nA = (9/4) * B\n\nNow, to find out how much more A is than B, subtract B from A:\n\nA - B = (9/4) * B - B\n\nTo combine these terms, we need a common denominator, which is 4:\n\nA - B = ((9B)/4) - (4B/4)\n\nNow, subtract the fractions:\n\nA - B = (9B - 4B) / 4\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\nA - B = 5B / 4\n\nSo, the first number is 5/4 times the second number. To express this as a difference, we can write it as:\n\nA = B + (5/4) * B\n\nThis means that the first number is equal to the second number plus one-fourth of the second number, or in other words, the first number is 1/4 more than the second number."

To reduce inventory pressure, it is initially discounted to 80% of its original price, and each set still yields a profit of 20%. After selling 100 sets at this price, there are 8 sets left, which are then further discounted by 80%. What is the total profit made by the store after all the clothing items have been sold?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the selling price for each set of clothing and then determine the total profit. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Calculate the initial discount (80% of 300 yuan):\n   Selling Price per Set = Original Price × Discount\n   = 300 yuan × 0.8\n   = 240 yuan\n\n2. Calculate the profit for each set sold at this price:\n   Profit per Set = Selling Price per Set × Profit Percentage\n   = 240 yuan × 0.2\n   = 48 yuan\n\n3. Calculate the total profit from selling 100 sets:\n   Total Profit (First Batch) = Profit per Set × Number of Sets Sold\n   = 48 yuan × 100\n   = 4,800 yuan\n\n4. Calculate the second discount for the remaining 8 sets (80% of 240 yuan):\n   Second Discount Price per Set = First Discount Price per Set × Second Discount\n   = 240 yuan × 0.8\n   = 192 yuan\n\n5. Calculate the total profit from selling the remaining 8 sets:\n   Total Profit (Second Batch) = Second Discount Price per Set × Number of Sets Sold\n   = 192 yuan × 8\n   = 1,536 yuan\n\n6. Calculate the overall total profit for the store:\n   Overall Total Profit = Total Profit (First Batch) + Total Profit (Second Batch)\n   = 4,800 yuan + 1,536 yuan\n   = 6,336 yuan\n\nSo, the total profit made by the store after selling all the clothing items is 6,336 yuan."

Now, we have one more pancake left to cook. We can't start cooking it until the previous batch is done, so we'll have to wait for 6 minutes before we can begin cooking the last pancake.\n4. Once the waiting time is over, we cook the final pancake for 3 minutes on each side, which takes another 6 minutes.\n\nAdding up the times:\nFirst batch: 6 minutes\nWaiting time: 6 minutes\nSecond batch (last pancake): 6 minutes\n\nTotal time required = 6 + 6 + 6 = **18 minutes**\n\nSo, it will take a minimum of 18 minutes to cook all three pancakes."

The area of the original wooden board is A = L * L (since it's a square).\n3. After sawing, the width of the remaining rectangular piece becomes (L - 0.4) meters.\n4. Given that the area of the remaining piece is 0.6 square meters, we can set up the equation: (L - 0.4) * L = 0.6\n5. Solving for L, we get L = 1 meter (since L must be positive).\n6. Therefore, the length of the sawed-off wooden strip is also 1 meter.\n7. The area of the sawed-off wooden strip is A' = 0.4 * 1 = 0.4 square meters.\n\nSo, the area of the sawed-off wooden strip is 0.4 square meters."

Buying ballpoint pens cost 1.6 yuan more than buying pencils in total. How much money was spent on buying these pens?\n\nLet's denote the number of pencils as P and the number of ballpoint pens as B. We have two equations based on the information given:\n\n1) P + B = 16 (total number of pens)\n2) 1.2B - 0.4P = 1.6 (difference in cost between ballpoint pens and pencils)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of P and B, and then calculate the total cost.\n\nFirst, let's multiply equation 2 by 4 to get rid of the decimals:\n\n4 * (1.2B - 0.4P) = 4 * 1.6\n4.8B - 1.6P = 6.4\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\n3) P + B = 16\n4) 4.8B - 1.6P = 6.4\n\nWe can solve equation 3 for P:\n\nP = 16 - B\n\nSubstitute this expression for P into equation 4:\n\n4.8B - 1.6(16 - B) = 6.4\n4.8B - 25.6 + 1.6B = 6.4\n6.4B - 25.6 = 6.4\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\n6.4B = 32\nB = 5\n\nNow that we know there are 5 ballpoint pens, we can find the number of pencils using equation 3:\n\nP + 5 = 16\nP = 11\n\nSo, there are 11 pencils and 5 ballpoint pens. The total cost for the pencils is:\n\nCost_pencils = 0.4 * P\nCost_pencils = 0.4 * 11\nCost_pencils = 4.4 yuan\n\nThe total cost for the ballpoint pens is:\n\nCost_ballpoint = 1.2 * B\nCost_ballpoint = 1.2 * 5\nCost_ballpoint = 6 yuan\n\nThe total cost for all the pens is:\n\nTotal_cost = Cost_pencils + Cost_ballpoint\nTotal_cost = 4.4 + 6\nTotal_cost = 10.4 yuan\n\nTherefore, a total of 10.4 yuan was spent on buying these pens."

If team A works alone, it takes them 20 days to complete the task, and if team B works alone, it takes them 30 days. How many days would it take for both teams to work together to complete the construction?\n\n**Solution:**\nLet's denote the amount of work done by team A in one day as \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\) (since they can complete the job in 20 days), and the amount of work done by team B in one day as \\( \\frac{1}{30} \\).\n\nWhen both teams work together, their combined daily work rate is:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{3}{60} + \\frac{2}{60} = \\frac{5}{60} \\]\n\nThis means that together, they can complete \\( \\frac{1}{60} \\) of the work in one day. To find out how many days it would take for them to complete the entire job, we divide the total amount of work (1) by their combined daily work rate:\n\n\\[ 1 \\div \\frac{5}{60} = \\frac{60}{5} = 12 \\]\n\nSo, it would take both teams working together 12 days to complete the construction of the road segment."

Then, according to the problem, the number of books on the 乙 bookcase would be (2/3)x.\n\nThe total number of books is the sum of the books on both bookcases, which gives us the equation:\n\nx + (2/3)x = 300\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n(1 + 2/3)x = 300\n(3/3 + 2/3)x = 300\n(5/3)x = 300\n\nTo find x, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (5/3), which is (3/5):\n\nx = 300 * (3/5)\nx = 180\n\nSo, there are 180 books on the 甲 bookcase.\n\nThe translated problem and solution would be:\n\n**Problem:**\nThere are a total of 300 books on two bookcases, A and B. The number of books on bookcase B is (2/3) of the number of books on bookcase A. How many books are there on bookcase A?\n\n**Solution:**\nLet x represent the number of books on bookcase A. Then, the number of books on bookcase B is (2/3)x.\n\nThe total number of books is given by:\nx + (2/3)x = 300\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n(5/3)x = 300\nx = 180\n\nTherefore, there are 180 books on bookcase A."

What is the minimum amount of square meters of wood board required to make this wooden crate?\"\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the surface area of the rectangular prism, which involves finding the sum of all its faces' areas. Since a rectangular prism has six faces (two opposite faces of each dimension), and they are all rectangles, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle (length × width) to find the area of each face.\n\nThe total surface area (SA) can be calculated as follows:\n\nSA = 2(lw + lh + wh)\n\nWhere:\n- l is the length,\n- w is the width,\n- h is the height.\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\nSA = 2((1.2m × 0.8m) + (1.2m × 0.6m) + (0.8m × 0.6m))\nSA = 2((0.96m²) + (0.72m²) + (0.48m²))\nSA = 2(2.16m²)\nSA = 4.32m²\n\nSo, at least 4.32 square meters of wood board is required to make the wooden crate."

In this case, the growth factor is 2 (since it grows by onefold each day), and we want to find out how many days it will take to reach a final length of 20 centimeters. We can set up the equation as follows:\n\n20 = 10 * (2 ^ x)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx ≈ log(2) / log(2)\nx ≈ 3\n\nSince we already know that it takes 10 days to reach 10 centimeters, and the growth is exponential, we can subtract those 10 days from our result:\n\n7 days = 3 days - 10 days\n\nTherefore, it will take 7 more days for the caterpillar to reach 20 centimeters.)"

How many ceramic tiles are needed to cover this water tank?\n\nTo solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total surface area of the tank that will be covered by the tiles. Since the tank is a rectangular prism, it has six faces: two lengthwise faces, two widthwise faces, and two heightwise faces.\n\nThe area of each face can be calculated as follows:\n- Lengthwise faces (2): 20m × 2m = 40m²\n- Widthwise faces (2): 10m × 2m = 20m²\n- Heightwise faces (2): 20m × 10m = 200m²\n\nNow, we add up the areas of all six faces to get the total surface area:\nTotal surface area = 40m² + 20m² + 200m² = 260m²\n\nSince each ceramic tile covers an area of (2cm)² = 4cm², we can find the number of tiles needed by dividing the total surface area by the area covered by one tile:\nNumber of tiles = Total surface area / Area per tile\nNumber of tiles = 260m² / 4cm²\n\nTo convert meters to centimeters (since the tile size is given in centimeters), we multiply by 100 (as there are 100 centimeters in a meter):\nNumber of tiles = (260m × 100) cm² / 4cm²\nNumber of tiles = 26,000cm² / 4cm²\nNumber of tiles = 6,500\n\nTherefore, 6,500 ceramic tiles are needed to cover the water tank."

Therefore, the amount of salt should be:\n\\[ (0.08) \\times (5 + x) \\, \\text{kg} \\]\n\nSince the amount of salt remains constant before and after adding water, we can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n\n\\[ (0.12) \\times 5 = (0.08) \\times (5 + x) \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[ 0.6 = 0.4 + 0.08x \\]\n\\[ 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.08x \\]\n\\[ 0.2 = 0.08x \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{0.2}{0.08} \\]\n\\[ x = 2.5 \\]\n\nSo, you need to add 2.5 kilograms of water to the 12% salt water to achieve an 8% salt concentration in the mixture."

If 0.8 kilograms of paint is used per square meter, and the cost of paint is 15 yuan per kilogram, with an additional labor cost of 0.5 yuan per square meter for the painters, please help our school calculate the total cost of this classroom painting project.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. Calculate the area of each classroom (excluding blackboards and windows):\n   Area = Length × Width\n         = 8m × 6m\n         = 48m²\n\n2. Add the area of blackboards and windows:\n   Total area per classroom = 48m² + 14m²\n                             = 62m²\n\n3. Calculate the total area for all 40 classrooms:\n   Total area = 62m² × 40\n              = 2,480m²\n\n4. Calculate the amount of paint needed for all classrooms:\n   Paint needed = Total area × Paint per square meter\n                = 2,480m² × 0.8kg/m²\n                = 1,984kg\n\n5. Calculate the cost of paint:\n   Cost of paint = Paint needed × Cost per kilogram\n                 = 1,984kg × 15yuan/kg\n                 = 29,760yuan\n\n6. Calculate the labor cost for all classrooms:\n   Labor cost = Total area × Labor cost per square meter\n              = 2,480m² × 0.5yuan/m²\n              = 1,240yuan\n\n7. Add the cost of paint and labor cost to get the total cost:\n   Total cost = Cost of paint + Labor cost\n               = 29,760yuan + 1,240yuan\n               = 30,900yuan\n\nTherefore, the total cost for this classroom painting project is 30,900 yuan."

How should the explanation and correction times be arranged to minimize the time spent by Mr. Wang? What is the minimum time required?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find an arrangement that minimizes the total time spent by Mr. Wang explaining and waiting for students to correct their homework. Since each student requires 3 minutes of explanation, we can calculate the total explanation time as follows:\n\nTotal explanation time = 3 minutes/student × 3 students = 9 minutes\n\nNow, let's consider the correction times for each student:\n- Student A: 16 minutes (3 minutes explanation + 13 minutes correction)\n- Student B: 13 minutes (3 minutes explanation + 10 minutes correction)\n- Student C: 19 minutes (3 minutes explanation + 16 minutes correction)\n\nTo minimize the total time, we should arrange the students in a way that Mr. Wang spends as little time waiting as possible. Since Student A takes the longest to correct their homework, they should be arranged last. This way, Mr. Wang can start explaining to Student B while Student A is still correcting.\n\nHere's an efficient arrangement:\n1. Mr. Wang explains to Student B for 3 minutes.\n2. While Student B starts correcting, Mr. Wang begins explaining to Student C for 3 minutes.\n3. After explaining to Student C, Mr. Wang waits for the remaining time until either Student B or C finishes their correction (whichever takes longer).\n4. Once one student is done, Mr. Wang explains to them again if necessary and then moves on to explain to Student A.\n\nIn this arrangement, the total waiting time for Mr. Wang would be:\n- Waiting after explaining to Student B: 10 minutes (Student B's correction time - explanation time)\n- Waiting after explaining to Student C: 16 minutes (Student C's correction time - explanation time)\n\nTotal waiting time = 10 minutes + 16 minutes = 26 minutes\n\nAdding the total explanation time, we get:\nMinimum total time = Total explanation time + Total waiting time\nMinimum total time = 9 minutes + 26 minutes = 35 minutes\n\nTherefore, the minimum time required for Mr. Wang to spend is 35 minutes."

First, let's eliminate fractions by multiplying each equation by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 6:\n\nFor the first equation:\n3 * ((1/2)G + (1/3)B) = 3 * 13\n=> G + 2B = 39\n\nFor the second equation:\n2 * ((1/2)B + (1/3)G) = 2 * 12\n=> B + 4G = 24\n\nNow we have a system of linear equations:\n\nG + 2B = 39\nB + 4G = 24\n\nLet's solve for G and B. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficient of B in both equations equal, then subtract the first equation from it:\n\n2(B + 4G) - (G + 2B) = 2 * 24 - 39\n=> 2B + 8G - G - 2B = 48 - 39\n=> 7G = 9\n\nNow, divide by 7 to find the number of girls:\n\nG = 9 / 7\nG ≈ 1.29 (since we can't have a fraction of a person)\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense in the context of the problem because we cannot have a fraction of a person participating in the choir. It seems there might be an error in the given information or in our calculations. Let's recheck our steps.\n\nWe made a mistake in the second step when multiplying by 6. We should multiply each equation by 6 to eliminate fractions:\n\nFor the first equation:\n6 * ((1/2)G + (1/3)B) = 6 * 13\n=> 3G + 2B = 78\n\nFor the second equation:\n6 * ((1/2)B + (1/3)G) = 6 * 12\n=> 3B + 2G = 72\n\nNow we have:\n\n3G + 2B = 78\n3B + 2G = 72\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n(3G + 2B) - (3B + 2G) = 78 - 72\n=> G - B = 6\n\nNow we have a new system of equations:\n\nG + 2B = 39\nG - B = 6\n\nAdd these two equations together to solve for G:\n\n(2G + 4B) + (G - B) = 39 + 6\n=> 3G + 3B = 45\n\nNow, divide by 3:\n\nG + B = 15\n\nWe already have the equation G - B = 6. Adding this to the new equation G + B = 15 gives us:\n\n2G = 21\n\nDivide by 2 to find the number of girls:\n\nG = 21 / 2\nG = 10.5\n\nThis still doesn't make sense because we can't have half a person in the choir.

Therefore, we need to calculate the excess amount and then apply the tax rate to find out how much personal income tax he has to pay each month.\n\nTo solve this problem, we first subtract 3000 from 3800 to find the excess amount:\n\n3800 - 3000 = 800\n\nNext, we multiply the excess amount by the tax rate of 3% (or 0.03) to calculate the personal income tax:\n\n800 * 0.03 = 24\n\nTherefore, Xiao Jun's father has to pay 24 yuan in personal income tax each month."

On the first day, they completed (1/5) of the total length, and on the second day, they completed (1/3) of it. If they are required to finish the remaining work on the third day, what fraction of the total length should they complete on that day?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how much of the road is left after the first two days and then determine what fraction of the total length that represents.\n\nFirst, let's find out how much of the road was completed in the first two days:\n\nOn the first day: (1/5) of the total length\nOn the second day: (1/3) of the total length\n\nTo add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 5 and 3 is 15, so we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 15:\n\nFirst day: (1/5) = (3/15)\nSecond day: (1/3) = (5/15)\n\nNow, add the two fractions together:\n(3/15) + (5/15) = (8/15)\n\nThis means that after two days, 8/15 of the road has been completed. To find out how much is left, we subtract this from the total length:\n\nTotal length - Completed length = Remaining length\n(5/6) - (8/15) = Remaining length\n\nTo subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator again. The least common multiple of 6 and 15 is 30, so we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 30:\n\nTotal length: (5/6) = (25/30)\nCompleted length: (8/15) = (16/30)\n\nNow, subtract the completed length from the total length:\n(25/30) - (16/30) = Remaining length\n(25/30) - (16/30) = (9/30)\n\nSimplify the fraction to get the remaining length in its simplest form:\n(9/30) = (3/10)\n\nSo, after two days, 3/10 of the road is left to be completed on the third day. To find out what fraction of the total length this represents, we divide the remaining length by the total length:\n\nRemaining length / Total length = Fraction of total length to complete on the third day\n(3/10) / (5/6) = (3/10) * (6/5)\n\nMultiply the numerators and denominators:\n(3 * 6) / (10 * 5) = 18 / 50\n\nSimplify the fraction to get the final answer:\n18 / 50 = 9 / 25\n\nTherefore, on the third day, the engineering team should complete 9/25 of the total length of the road."

The area of the doors and windows is 25 square meters. If each square meter requires 200 grams of paint, how many kilograms of paint are needed in total?\n\nTo solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total area that needs to be painted, which includes the four walls and the ceiling. The area of the two longer walls is (9m * 3m) * 2 = 54 square meters, and the area of the two shorter walls is (7m * 3m) * 2 = 42 square meters. The area of the ceiling is (9m * 7m) = 63 square meters. So, the total area to be painted is 54 + 42 + 63 - 25 (subtracting the area of doors and windows) = 134 square meters.\n\nNow, we calculate the total amount of paint needed: 134 m² * 200g/m² = 26800 grams. To convert this to kilograms, we divide by 1000 (since there are 1000 grams in a kilogram): 26800g / 1000 = 26.8 kg.\n\nTherefore, 26.8 kilograms of paint are needed in total."

What is the correct formula?\"\n\nTo find out how many hectares are plowed per hour on average, you would divide the total area plowed by the total time taken:\n\nArea plowed per hour = Total area / Total time\n= (7/8) hectares / (3/10) hours\n\nTo simplify this, we can multiply by the reciprocal of the time fraction to get the correct formula:\n\nArea plowed per hour = (7/8) * (10/3) hectares/hour\n= 75/24 hectares/hour\n\nSo, the tractor plows 75/24 hectares of land per hour on average."

Then multiply this result by the known number to get the unknown number: 90 × 6 = 540.

The correct approach is to consider that if one number is 90, which is divisible by both 30 (the greatest common divisor) and 6 (since 180 ÷ 90 = 2), then the other number must also be a multiple of these divisors to have a least common multiple of 180 and a greatest common divisor of 30.

On the third and fourth days, it drove half of the total distance. What was the total length of this journey in kilometers?\n\nAnswer: The total length of the journey was 1400 kilometers.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLet's denote the total distance as D kilometers.\n\nOn the first day, the car traveled 360 km, so the remaining distance after the first day is (D - 360) km.\n\nOn the second day, it traveled (2/7) of the remaining distance, which can be expressed as (2/7)(D - 360).\n\nThe total distance covered in three days is the sum of the distances traveled on each of those days:\n\n360 + (2/7)(D - 360)\n\nOn the third and fourth days, the car traveled half of the total distance, which can be expressed as (1/2)D.\n\nSo, the equation representing the total distance covered in four days is:\n\n360 + (2/7)(D - 360) + (1/2)D = D\n\nNow, let's solve for D:\n\n360 + (2/7)D - (480/7) + (1/2)D = D\n(9/2)D - (480/7) = 0\n(9/2)D = (480/7)\nD = (480 * 7) / (9 * 2)\nD = (480 * 7) / 18\nD = 360 * 7\nD = 2520\n\nHowever, this result does not make sense in the context of the problem because it would mean that the car traveled more than twice the distance on the third and fourth days combined. This suggests there might be a mistake in our interpretation or calculation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the problem:\n\nOn the first day, the car traveled 360 km, so the remaining distance after the first day is (D - 360) km.\n\nOn the second day, it traveled (2/7) of the remaining distance, which can be expressed as (2/7)(D - 360).\n\nThe total distance covered in three days is the sum of the distances traveled on each of those days:\n\n360 + (2/7)(D - 360)\n\nOn the third and fourth days, the car traveled half of the remaining distance after the second day, which can be expressed as (1/2)((D - 360) - (2/7)(D - 360)).\n\nSo, the equation representing the total distance covered in four days is:\n\n360 + (2/7)(D - 360) + (1/2)((D - 360) - (2/7)(D - 360)) = D\n\nNow, let's solve for D:\n\n360 + (2/7)(D - 360) + (1/2)((5/7)(D - 360)) = D\n360 + (2/7)D - (480/7) + (5/14)(D - 360) = D\n(9/2)D - (480/7) + (5/14)(D - 360) = 0\n(9/2)D + (5/14)D = (480/7) + (5 * 360/14)\n(135/14)D = (480/7) + (1800/14)\n(135/14)D = (240/7) + (900/14)\n(135/14)D = (600/14)\nD = (600 * 14) / (135)\nD = (80 * 14)\nD = 1120\n\nSo, the total length of the journey was 1120 kilometers."

Xixi can print Dad's thesis alone in 2 hours and Mom's thesis alone in 8 hours. How should Dongdong and Xixi cooperate to complete both theses?

Little Harry ordered noodles and had to wait 5 minutes. Little Gary ordered dumplings and had to wait 4 minutes, while Little Susan ordered eggs and had to wait 3 minutes. There was only one chef in the kitchen. How should they be arranged so that the total waiting time for all three children is minimized? What is the minimum total waiting time?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a simple scheduling algorithm:\n\n1. The child with the shortest waiting time goes first (Little Susan, 3 minutes).\n2. Then, the child with the next shortest waiting time (Little Gary, 4 minutes) goes second.\n3. Finally, the child with the longest waiting time (Little Harry, 5 minutes) goes last.\n\nBy following this order, we minimize the total waiting time for all three children. The minimum total waiting time is:\n\n3 minutes (Little Susan) + 4 minutes (Little Gary) + 5 minutes (Little Harry) = 12 minutes\n\nSo, the answer is that they should be arranged in the order of Little Susan, Little Gary, and then Little Harry, with a minimum total waiting time of 12 minutes."

Since 5 is a prime number, the only possible value for x that satisfies this condition is when both 9 + x and 31 + x are multiples of 7.\n\nLet's check if there exists an integer x such that:\n\n(9 + x) / 7 = (31 + x) / 7 = 5\n\nMultiplying both sides by 7, we get:\n\n9 + x = 35 + 5x\n4x = 26\nx = 6.5\n\nHowever, since x must be an integer, there seems to be no solution that satisfies the given conditions with the information provided.

After giving some away, he was left with 25 pictures. So we can set up the following equation:\n\nx - [(x/2) + 1] = 25\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\nFirst, distribute the negative sign inside the parentheses:\nx - (x/2) - 1 = 25\n\nCombine like terms by adding (x/2) to both sides of the equation:\n(3/2)x - 1 = 25\n\nAdd 1 to both sides to isolate the term with x on one side:\n(3/2)x = 26\n\nNow, divide both sides by (3/2) to solve for x:\nx = 26 / (3/2)\n\nTo divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:\nx = 26 * (2/3)\n\nFinally, perform the multiplication:\nx = 52/3\n\nSo, Zhang Xiaoming originally had 52/3 pictures, which is approximately 17.33 pictures. However, since you can't have a fraction of a picture, we should round to the nearest whole number if necessary. In this case, it seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement as given, as having half plus one more picture would not result in a whole number of remaining pictures.

Let's denote the number of boys as \\( x \\). Then, the number of girls would be \\( \\frac{3}{5}x \\).\n\nThe total number of students in the class is 56, so we can write the following proportion:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\text{Number of girls}}{\\text{Total number of students}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{5}x}{56}\\]\n\nSince there are 56 students in total, we can cross-multiply to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[56 \\times \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}x\\]\n\nNow, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\):\n\n\\[x = 56 \\times \\frac{5}{3}\\]\n\n\\[x = 7\\]\n\nThus, there are also 7 boys in the class using this method."

The difference he got was 24. What is the correct answer to this problem?\n\nTo solve this, we need to find out what the original numbers were before Big Tiger made his mistakes.\n\nLet's denote the tens digit of the minuend as \\( x \\). Since Big Tiger wrote a 7 instead of an 8 in the tens place, the actual number he should have written is \\( 10x + 8 \\).\n\nSimilarly, let's denote the ones digit of the subtrahend as \\( y \\). Since Big Tiger wrote a 9 instead of a 6 in the ones place, the actual number he should have written is \\( 10y + 6 \\).\n\nThe correct subtraction problem would look like this:\n\n\\[\n(10x + 8) - (10y + 6) = 24\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10x + 8 - 10y - 6 &= 24 \\\\\n10x - 10y &= 24 - 8 + 6 \\\\\n10(x - y) &= 22 \\\\\nx - y &= 2.2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are digits, they must be whole numbers. Therefore, we can deduce that \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\).\n\nNow we can find the correct minuend and subtrahend:\n\nMinuend: \\( 10x + 8 = 10(3) + 8 = 38 \\)\nSubtrahend: \\( 10y + 6 = 10(1) + 6 = 16 \\)\n\nSo the correct subtraction problem is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Minuend} & : & 38 \\\\\n- \\text{Subtrahend} & : & 16 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Difference} & : & 22\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the problem should be \\( 22 \\)."

    "original_text_en": "Here's the translation of the math problem:\n\nThere is a department store that bought goods worth 40,000 yuan on its first purchase. After selling them all, it bought another batch of goods worth 88,000 yuan, which was twice the amount of the first purchase and each item was 4 yuan more expensive than the first batch. Now, each item is sold for 58 yuan, and when there are only 150 items left, they are sold at an 80% discount (i.e., 80% of the original price). The question asks: How much money did the department store make in total?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the profit made from both purchases and then add them together. Here's how:\n\n1. Calculate the cost per item for the first batch:\n   Cost per item = Total cost / Number of items\n   Since we don't know the number of items, let's call it \"x\". So, the cost per item is 40,000 / x yuan.\n\n2. Calculate the selling price per item for the first batch:\n   Selling price per item = Cost per item + Profit per item\n   We know that each item was sold for 58 yuan after being marked up by 4 yuan from its original cost, so the profit per item is 4 yuan. Therefore, the selling price per item for the first batch is (40,000 / x) + 4 yuan.\n\n3. Calculate the total revenue from the first batch:\n   Total revenue = Selling price per item * Number of items\n   So, the total revenue from the first batch is (40,000 / x + 4) * x yuan.\n\n4. Calculate the cost per item for the second batch:\n   Since each item in the second batch was bought at a price that is 4 yuan more than the first batch, the cost per item for the second batch is (40,000 / x) + 4 yuan.\n\n5. Calculate the selling price per item for the second batch before the discount:\n   The selling price per item for the second batch is also 58 yuan since it's the same as the first batch after being marked up by 4 yuan from its original cost.\n\n6. Calculate the total revenue from the second batch with the discount:\n   When there are only 150 items left, they are sold at an 80% discount. So, the selling price per item for these remaining items is 58 * 0.8 = 46.4 yuan.\n   The total revenue from the second batch with the discount is 46.4 * 150 yuan.\n\n7. Calculate the profit made from both batches:\n   Profit from the first batch = Total revenue from the first batch - Total cost of the first batch\n   Profit from the second batch = Total revenue from the second batch with the discount - Total cost of the second batch\n\n8. Calculate the total profit:\n   Total profit = Profit from the first batch + Profit from the second batch\n\nNow, let's calculate the values step by step:\n\n1. Cost per item for the first batch: 40,000 / x yuan\n2. Selling price per item for the first batch: (40,000 / x) + 4 yuan\n3. Total revenue from the first batch: (40,000 / x + 4) * x = 40,000 + 4x yuan\n4. Cost per item for the second batch: (40,000 / x) + 4 yuan\n5. Selling price per item for the second batch before the discount: 58 yuan\n6. Total revenue from the second batch with the discount: 46.4 * 150 = 6,960 yuan\n7. Profit from the first batch: (40,000 + 4x) - 40,000 = 4x yuan\n8. Profit from the second batch: 6,960 - (88,000 / x * ((40,000 / x) + 4)) = 6,960 - (352,000,000 / x^2 + 352,000 / x) yuan\n9. Total profit: 4x + 6,960 - (352,000,000 / x^2 + 352,000 / x) yuan\n\nWithout the number of items \"x\" from the first batch, we cannot calculate the exact total profit. However, this is how you would approach solving the problem with the given information."

The time taken to walk each segment has a ratio of 3:4:5. Given that the person's walking speed on the downhill is 6 kilometers per hour, how much time does it take for him to complete the entire journey?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the actual lengths of each segment and then calculate the time taken for each based on the given ratios and speeds.\n\n1. First, let's find the length of each segment using the ratio 1:2:3.\n   - Let x be the common multiplier for the lengths. Then:\n     - Uphill segment length = 1x\n     - Flat segment length = 2x\n     - Downhill segment length = 3x\n\n2. Since the total length of the road is 48 kilometers, we can write an equation to find x:\n   1x + 2x + 3x = 48\n   6x = 48\n   x = 8\n\n3. Now we can calculate the actual lengths of each segment:\n   - Uphill segment length = 1 * 8 = 8 km\n   - Flat segment length = 2 * 8 = 16 km\n   - Downhill segment length = 3 * 8 = 24 km\n\n4. Next, we'll find the time taken for each segment using the given speed and time ratios.\n\n5. For the downhill segment:\n   Speed = 6 km/hour\n   Time ratio = 5 (for all segments combined)\n   Actual time for downhill = (Time ratio / Speed) * Downhill segment length\n   = (5 / 6) * 24 hours\n   = 20 hours\n\n6. Since the time ratios for uphill and flat segments are 3 and 4 respectively, we can find their actual times using the same method:\n   - Uphill time = (3 / 6) * 8 hours = 4 hours\n   - Flat time = (4 / 6) * 16 hours = 10.67 hours\n\n7. Finally, to find the total time taken for the entire journey, we add up the times for all segments:\n   Total time = Uphill time + Flat time + Downhill time\n   = 4 hours + 10.67 hours + 20 hours\n   = 34.67 hours\n\nTherefore, it takes approximately 34.67 hours for him to complete the entire journey."

    "original_text_en": "Here's the translation of the math problem:\n\n**Problem:**\nA, B, C, and D are four people who contribute an equal amount of money to purchase the same number of identical items. After purchasing the items, A, B, and C have 3, 7, and 14 more items than D respectively. When settling the bill, B pays D 14 yuan. How much should C pay D?\n\n**Solution:**\nLet's denote the total amount of money contributed by each person as x yuan, and the price per item as y yuan.\n\nAccording to the problem, we have:\nA + B + C + D = 4x (Equation 1)\n(A + 3) + (B + 7) + (C + 14) + D = 4y (Equation 2)\n\nWe also know that B pays D 14 yuan, so:\nB - D = 14 (Equation 3)\n\nNow we can solve for C's payment to D. First, let's find the value of A + B + C using Equation 1 and Equation 3:\n\nA + B + C = 4x - D\n\nSubstitute B from Equation 3 into the above equation:\nA + (D + 14) + C = 4x - D\nA + D + 14 + C = 4x - D\nA + C + 28 = 4x (Equation 4)\n\nNow, let's find the value of A + B + C using Equation 2 and Equation 3:\n\n(A + 3) + (B + 7) + (C + 14) + D = 4y\nA + B + C + 24 + D = 4y\n\nSubstitute B from Equation 3 into the above equation:\nA + (D - 14) + C + 24 + D = 4y\nA + C + 28 + D = 4y (Equation 5)\n\nNow we have two equations with A, C, and D: Equation 4 and Equation 5. We can set them equal to each other since they both represent the sum of A, C, and D plus constants:\n\n4x - D + 28 = 4y\n\nSolve for D:\nD = 4x - 4y + 28 (Equation 6)\n\nNow we need to find out how much C should pay D. Since B pays D 14 yuan, the remaining amount that needs to be paid by C is:\n\nC's payment to D = Total payment - B's payment\n= (A + B + C + D) * y - (B - D) * y\n= (4x - D) * y - (D - 14) * y\n\nSubstitute the value of D from Equation 6 into the above equation:\nC's payment to D = (4x - (4x - 4y + 28)) * y - ((4x - 4y + 28) - 14) * y\n= (4y - 28) * y\n\nSo, C should pay D (4y - 28) yuan."

The median is the average of the two middle numbers when the data is arranged in order. Since there are eight numbers in total, the fourth and fifth positions will be the middle values.\n\nSo, we have:\n13, 14, 19, X, 23, 27, 28, 31\n\nThe median (22) should be the average of 'X' and 23. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(X + 23) / 2 = 22\n\nNow, solve for X:\nX + 23 = 44\nX = 44 - 23\nX = 21\n\nThus, the value of 'X' is 21."

Little Hong, Little Dong, and Little Sun each want to use this rope to enclose an area on the playground (without touching any walls). How can they enclose the largest possible area? What is the maximum area they can enclose in square meters?\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo enclose the largest possible area without touching any walls, the three of them should form a right-angled triangle with the rope as the hypotenuse. The enclosed area will be a right-angled triangle as well.\n\nThe length of the other two sides (legs) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nLet's denote the lengths of the two legs as x and y meters. Then, we have:\nx² + y² = 31.4²\n\nSince the area of a right-angled triangle is given by (1/2) * base * height, we want to maximize this value subject to the constraint that x² + y² = 31.4².\n\nUsing the AM-GM inequality, we know that for any two positive numbers a and b, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean: (a + b)/2 ≥ √(ab).\n\nApplying this to our case, we have:\n(x + y) / 2 ≥ √(x * y)\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives us:\nx + y ≥ 2√(x * y)\n\nNow, let's substitute x² + y² for 31.4² in the inequality:\n√(31.4²) ≥ 2√(x * y)\n\nSquaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives us:\n31.4² ≥ 4(x * y)\n\nNow, we can solve for the maximum area (A):\nA = (1/2) * x * y ≤ (1/2) * (31.4² / 4)\nA ≤ 78.5\n\nSo, the maximum area they can enclose is 78.5 square meters when they form a right-angled triangle with the rope as the hypotenuse and use the entire length of the rope for both legs."

After A gave 2 toys to B and B gave 3 toys to C, all three ended up with 14 toys each. How many toys did A originally have?\n\n**Solution (in English):**\nLet's denote the original number of toys that A, B, and C had as a, b, and c respectively.\n\nAccording to the problem, we can set up the following equation:\n\na - 2 + b - 3 + c = 14\n\nSince all three now have 14 toys each, we also know that:\n\nb + 3 = 14 (because B gave away 3 toys)\nc + 2 = 14 (because C received 2 toys from B)\n\nFrom these two equations, we can find the original number of toys for B and C:\n\nb = 14 - 3 = 11\nc = 14 - 2 = 12\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the first equation to solve for a:\n\na - 2 + 11 - 3 + 12 = 14\na - 7 + 26 = 14\na + 19 = 14\na = 14 - 19\na = -5\n\nHowever, it doesn't make sense for A to originally have a negative number of toys. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement or our interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the information given:\n\nAfter A gives 2 toys to B and B gives 3 toys to C, all three should have an equal number of toys (14 each). This means that before any transactions, the total number of toys among A, B, and C was 14 * 3 = 42.\n\nSo, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\na + b + c = 42\n\nNow, using the values for b and c we found earlier (b = 11, c = 12), we can solve for a:\n\na + 11 + 12 = 42\na + 23 = 42\na = 42 - 23\na = 19\n\nTherefore, A originally had 19 toys."

At 10:00 AM, a passenger car leaves from point B to point A at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour. When the two vehicles meet, they are exactly at the midpoint between points A and B. Please calculate the distance between points A and B.\n\nThe solution involves recognizing that the two vehicles will meet after traveling for the same amount of time since they start at the same time but from opposite ends and meet at the midpoint. Let's denote the meeting time as t hours (from 8:00 AM). The truck travels for t hours, while the passenger car travels for (10 - 8) = 2 hours.\n\nUsing the formula distance = speed × time, we can set up an equation:\n\nDistance traveled by the truck + Distance traveled by the passenger car = Total distance between A and B\n\n50t + 60(2) = Total distance between A and B\n\nSince they meet at the midpoint, the total distance is twice the distance each vehicle travels before meeting. Therefore, we can write:\n\nTotal distance between A and B = 2 × (Distance traveled by the truck or passenger car)\n\nSubstituting the equation for the distance traveled by the truck into this expression gives us:\n\nTotal distance between A and B = 2 × (50t)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of t. Since they meet at the midpoint, the time it takes for each vehicle to reach the meeting point is half the total time from when they start until they meet. The passenger car travels for 2 hours, so the truck must also travel for 2 hours (since they meet at the same time). Therefore, t = 2.\n\nSubstituting this value back into our equation gives us:\n\nTotal distance between A and B = 2 × (50 × 2)\nTotal distance between A and B = 2 × 100\nTotal distance between A and B = 200 kilometers\n\nSo, the distance between points A and B is 200 kilometers."
